# SOC-HoneyPot-Lab

## Objective

In this lab, the objectives are to configure and analyze honeypot data using a SIEM platform to detect and correlate suspicious activities, simulate real-world attack scenarios for enhanced threat intelligence, and develop effective incident response strategies based on the insights gathered.
